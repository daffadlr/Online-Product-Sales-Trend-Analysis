ales trend analysis using RFM clustering to segment customers and ARIMA for time series forecasting. Processed and visualized large datasets to derive actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies. 
Implemented data preprocessing, model evaluation, and performance reporting using Python and SQL.

The vgasales.csv file contains a dataset of video game sales across different regions, including North America (NA_Sales), Europe (EU_Sales), Japan (JP_Sales), and other regions (Other_Sales). 
It also includes the names of the games, allowing for further analysis of their sales performance worldwide

The gamessalesrowdcloud.py script is a Python program that processes this dataset to analyze game sales. It reads the CSV file using pandas, extracts relevant columns, and calculates the total sales for each game. 
The script then generates a word cloud where the size of each game's name is proportional to its total sales, visually representing the most successful titles. 
Additionally, it creates a bar chart displaying the top 10 best-selling games. The visualization is saved as an image file for further reference.
